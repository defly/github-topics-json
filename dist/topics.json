In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n\nIPFS combines a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other, except for every node they are connected to. Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, a problem common with HTTP."
